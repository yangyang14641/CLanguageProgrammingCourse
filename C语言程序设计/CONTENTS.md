Seven times homework: from simple basic concept practices to high level funny program design. 
These homeworks were setup and submit every week in 2012 spring term, considering other subjects these job let me feel really both cool and tired in that time.
There are five on course experiments, and these jobs were adviced by the professor and teaching assistant(Graduate Student) in College of Computer Science of CQU.
We were demanded to finish these experiments in class, and this is really a big challenge, in case of high score, I try my best to finish these jobs in class, however i failed for several times.
These files also contain a Big-Project folder, which contains the mid-term exam and the finial program design.
This is my first time to systemically leanrn a programming language: C lang. 
The course material is CQU's C lang book. 
Many years ago after I learnt Unix type systems, I read Brian W. Kernighan and Dennis M. Ritchie's <<The C Programming Language>> and knowing more high level knowledges of C language, that's another cool thing for me!
